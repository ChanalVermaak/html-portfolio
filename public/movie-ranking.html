<h1>Greatest Movies of all time according to me - Chanal</h1>
<h2>Top 3 of my favourite movies</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>1.Criminal Minds </h3>
<p>This is a series but it is literally the greatest thing to watch. The characters are great, every episode has you on the edge of your seat... You just have to watch it.</p>

<h3>2.Barbie: Princess and the Pauper </h3>
<p>This one is a classic. The characters again - phenomenal. The message is also kinda relatable.</p>

<h3>3.The Proposal </h3>
<p>I love Sandra Bullock and would honestly watch any movie that she's in. The movie is also hilarious. It's set in Alaska and after watching the movie, I want to live there.</p>
